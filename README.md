## 🏰 Project Vision: The Digital Fortress

This project is not merely a promotional website for "The Sins of the Fathers"; it is a **"Digital Fortress"** and a **"Visual Bible"**—a living, breathing universe designed to pull the reader into its very core. The core philosophy is to transform the reader from a passive consumer into an active citizen of this dark world, an agent uncovering its deepest secrets. `thesinsofthefathers.com` is an operational hub where the story continues to unfold through interactive maps, dynamic timelines, and clandestine lore, far beyond the confines of the written word.

## 🏛️ Architecture: A Hybrid Behemoth

The platform is engineered upon a sophisticated, high-performance hybrid architecture, meticulously designed to serve two distinct purposes:

### ⚡️ **1. The Landing & Core Experience (Static)**
This is the main gateway, optimized for breathtaking speed and immediate engagement. It's built as a static site, leveraging a direct build process for maximum performance and reliability.
- **Technology Stack:** `HTML5`, `Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)`, `Tailwind CSS (compiled via PostCSS)`.

### 📚 **2. The Blog & Lore Engine (Server-Side Rendered)**
This is the dynamic heart of the universe, where the ever-expanding lore, character archives, and narrative content reside. It operates in SSR mode to ensure content is always fresh, deeply indexable by search engines, and delivered with optimal performance.
- **Technology Stack:** `Astro v5 (SSR)`, `Firebase Functions`, `Sanity.io (Headless CMS)`.
